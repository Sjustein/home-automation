Scripts I use for home automation stuff

Setup:
1. local-test.ps1: Run this script to test/debug the script locally.
1. trigger-homeassistant.ps1: Run this script to trigger events on home-assistant.
1. WindowsLogin.ps1: This script runs when every I logon to my Windows machine (thanks to some Windows Task scheduling as explained [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/141894/how-to-use-powershell-to-detect-logins-and-alert-through-email/)).
1. utils.ps1: Some useful functions to log both to a file and to the host for example.
